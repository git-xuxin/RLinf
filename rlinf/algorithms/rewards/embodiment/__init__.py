"""Embodied reward models for reinforcement learning.

This package provides reward model implementations for embodied RL tasks,
including both image-based (single-frame) and video-based (multi-frame) models.

Available Models:
    - ResNetRewardModel: ResNet-based binary classifier for success detection.
    - Qwen3VLRewardModel: Qwen3-VL based video reward model (placeholder).

Usage:
    The recommended way to use reward models is through the RewardManager:

    ```python
    from rlinf.algorithms.rewards.embodiment import RewardManager

    # Initialize from config
    reward_manager = RewardManager(cfg.reward)

    # Compute rewards
    rewards = reward_manager.compute_rewards(observations, task_descriptions)
    ```

    Alternatively, you can instantiate models directly:

    ```python
    from rlinf.algorithms.rewards.embodiment import ResNetRewardModel

    model = ResNetRewardModel(cfg)
    rewards = model.compute_reward(observations)
    ```
